To delay your inevitable demise, stack blocks as high as possible so they get crushed instead of you!

Use only the mouse to control yourself, pick up blocks, and throw them skyward.

* Hold the left mouse button over a block (while in range) to grab it.
* Use the mouse to adjust the trajectory.
* Use the mouse wheel to rotate the block.
* Release to throw, hopefully to land on top of your stack!
* Hold right mouse button to enter a temporary slow motion mode.
